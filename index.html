        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>The problem we have chosen to tackle with this project is the ongoing issue of vandalism in our school bathrooms which have lead to the closure of many of the school’s bathrooms, leading students to walk across campus to the nearest bathroom that is open. Janitors having to often work long hours cleaning the bathrooms to make sure they are actually usable is taking to much time to do and is too much work for the janitors. Students having to walk half way across campus to use the closest bathroom is taking to much time and they are often missing out on important information being presented in class. Students do not always know how long going to the bathroom could take, because they don’t know which are open and which are closed. Emergencies are also a problem, and with longer distances to bathrooms and no knowledge of whether bathrooms are unlocked, certain outcomes can be disastrous. Some previous solutions to these problems are SSICA, an ID Card scanning software and paper logs, a more primitive approach.</p>

      <section id="solution">
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>Our solution is to implement an affordable barcode scanner running polished and easy to use software to scan the id cards of students as they enter and exit the room to go to the bathroom. The ID numbers would be stored. We plan to make a prototype for a small scanner using a Raspberry Pi. The time the student leaves and returns to the classroom will be recorded and saved to a database. School administrators will have access to a website where they can look up who was in the bathroom at a certain time or when a certain person went to the bathroom. A further tier concept on the website is to add an algorithm to catch the culprits. This algorithm works by adding a point to every time a student uses a certain bathroom, and that day there is vandalism. Students with the most points will be the most suspicious to teachers, in which they can investigate on their own.  Doing this will help catch the person who is vandalizing by finding a correlation between occurrences of vandalism and who was in the bathroom at the time. Our solution does not solve vandalism, but minimizes it in two ways. One, the culprit knows they are being tracked and this will hamper their attempts to vandalism in a bathroom. This is similar to the concept a fake camera is implemented for. This concept is when a criminal would want to commit a crime, but see’s a camera and stops, for fear of getting caught. Since cameras in bathrooms are illegal, this is our method. The second way is using the algorithm said before to track down possible candidates of loss of bathroom privileges.  Our solutions allows better tracking of students on which bathrooms they go to. Say one bathroom is closed on their building, if they need to go to another building they are able to. The flexible system scans which bathroom they are in, so they do not need to worry about the system falsely accusing them of vandalising. The system is not an honor system, so lying about certain whereabouts are diminished completely. Using a raspberry pi and the camera, for our prototype was 50 dollars. However, this is a prototype and worked very well, if we get manufacturing costs down and create more affordable computers for it, we believe we could get it to 20 - 25$. The permanent solution will pay for itself in no time and vandalism will not longer be an issue. </p>

Outside of these topics, he enjoys researching about cars and socializing with his friends. In the future, he hopes to be an AI researcher. For this project, he worked solely on researching to find a solution to get barcode scanning to work on the Raspberry PI in SimpleCV, eventually getting it to a phase where it can send the barcode data to a database.</p>
